![Microsoft AI Tour Banner](./media/aitour-banner.png)

### Perform a challenging migration to a completely different language

- **Who is this for**: Any technologist that is looking to apply AI pair-programming techniques with GitHub Copilot to perform challenging work like migrating or translating from one programming language to another.
- **What you'll learn**: You'll use advanced GitHub Copilot techniques that are specifically useful when translating projects in different programming languages, as well as the different modes GitHub Copilot has to offer.
- **What you'll work on**: An HTTP API used to gather seasonal weather data that uses Rust with full compatibility from the original HTTP API written in Python.


## Learning Objectives 

In this workshop, you will:

  - Learn the differences about each of the GitHub Copilot Modes, when to use each one, best practices and tools to help you get the most out of your interactions.
  - Understand the differences between Python and Rust for web development
  - Learn the key differences in syntax, libraries, and frameworks when transitioning from Python's FastAPI to Rust's actix-web.
  - Implement JSON Serialization and Deserialization in Rust.
  - Gain hands-on experience using the serde library to handle JSON data, ensuring compatibility with the original Python API.
  - Develop and Validate Incremental Endpoints in Rust.
  - Practice creating and testing individual endpoints iteratively, ensuring correctness and alignment with the original Python API.
  - Optimize Performance and Identify Bottlenecks in Rust: Learn to analyze and address potential performance issues, such as redundant file serialization, while building a production-ready Rust application.

## ðŸ“£ Prerequisites

Before joining the workshop, there is only one prerequisite: you must have your own GitHub account. All resources, dependencies, and data are part of the repository itself. Make sure you have your GitHub Copilot license, trial, or the free version.

If you don't have a GitHub account yet, you can create one for free by following the instructions below.

1. Go to [GitHub's Sign Up Page](https://github.com/join).
2. Enter your email address, create a password, and choose a username. We recommend using a *personal email address* over a work one, to simplify the registration process.
3. Select your Country/Region and agree to the terms of service.
4. Click on the **Create account** button and wait for the verification email to arrive in your inbox.
